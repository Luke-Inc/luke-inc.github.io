            <p>
            <br>The application that nobody asked for is here!</br>
            
            <br>Tired of having to use 42 different aps for training and health? Here's another one!</br>

            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>Create a profile and let you and your friends follow your progress and statistics.</li>
                    
                <li> Plan, create and share those insane training sessions that everyone knows you actually did not do.</li>
                        
                <li> Track running, strength traning, climbing and berry-picking.</li>
                            
                <li>Inspire your friends by sharing your training through our social media platform.</li>
                                
                <li>Gro also collects health information about the user, including age, weight, height and information collected from tracked activities, mentioned above. </li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>
                As if that were not enough, there are currently two shitloads of additional features
                coming your way that will make the application so complicated, solving global warming will be easier
                than navigating through this mess. 
                What are you waiting for?
                <br>Grab your shoes and go for a run. </br>Gro will ensure the air remains pure. Yeah, that's right.
